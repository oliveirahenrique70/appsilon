This repository contains the files used to create the Marine Shiny App. The App illustrates the longest distance between two consecutive observations for multiple ships.

Furthermore, this repository has the R code used to refine the raw dataset provided "ships.csv" and create the clean dataset "ShipsAppData.csv" used in the App. Furthermore, this repository also contains the image used in the App and the R code that reproduces the report.

You can access the Marine Shiny App using the following link:
